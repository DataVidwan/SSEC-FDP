Through this Faculty Development Program, I have discovered the power of AI as a supportive assistant in teaching and research. Before this program, preparing abstracts, drafting reports, or searching for suitable journals often consumed hours of manual effort. Now, with tools like ChatGPT and Scispace, I can generate a first draft within minutes, which gives me more time to refine the content and add my own insights.

I found Paperpal and Quillbot extremely useful for improving the quality of academic writing. They ensure that my documents follow a professional tone and help eliminate grammatical or structural errors. For research purposes, Elsevier Journal Finder and Springer Journal Suggester provide me with reliable options to target the right journals, reducing the risk of rejection due to scope mismatch.

The sessions on presentation tools such as Gamma and SlidesGPT were equally impactful. As faculty, we often struggle with slide design, but these AI tools allow me to convert text into visually appealing slides effortlessly. This will directly improve the quality of my classroom presentations.

Most importantly, I have learned the ethical side of AI use. Tools like ZeroGPT remind us to validate originality, and peer review discussions emphasized that AI should not replace our academic judgment. Instead, AI helps us focus on critical thinking, creativity, and mentoring students.

Overall, this FDP has changed my perspective on technology in education. My AI Toolkit is not just a collection of apps but a practical system that I will continue using to save time, enhance research quality, and make my teaching more engaging.
